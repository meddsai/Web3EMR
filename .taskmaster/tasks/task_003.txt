# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Decentralized Identity with Polkadot People Chain
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a robust DID solution using Polkadot's People Chain for secure, verifiable digital identities for all system participants.
# Details:
1. Integrate with Polkadot's People Chain for identity management
2. Implement DID creation and management using the Identity pallet
3. Develop verification mechanisms for DIDs through the People Chain
4. Create functionality for linking DIDs to on-chain attestations and credentials
5. Implement sub-identities for hierarchical identity structures (up to 100 per primary account)
6. Develop interfaces for DID management in the runtime and frontend
7. Implement identity revocation and recovery mechanisms
8. Add support for verifiable credentials and selective disclosure

Pseudo-code for Polkadot People Chain DID integration:
```rust
// In runtime/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
pallet-identity = { version = "25.0.0", default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git" }

// In runtime/src/lib.rs
parameter_types! {
    pub const BasicDeposit: Balance = 10 * DOLLARS;  // 10 DOT or your chain's token
    pub const FieldDeposit: Balance = 0.25 * DOLLARS; // 0.25 DOT per field
    pub const SubAccountDeposit: Balance = 2 * DOLLARS; // 2 DOT per sub-account
    pub const MaxSubAccounts: u32 = 100;
}

impl pallet_identity::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type Currency = Balances;
    type BasicDeposit = BasicDeposit;
    type FieldDeposit = FieldDeposit;
    type SubAccountDeposit = SubAccountDeposit;
    type MaxSubAccounts = MaxSubAccounts;
    type MaxAdditionalFields = ConstU32<32>;  // Max additional fields per identity
    type MaxRegistrars = ConstU32<20>;       // Max registrars
    type Slash = ();
    type ForceOrigin = frame_system::EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
    type WeightInfo = pallet_identity::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
}

// In pallets/emr/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
frame-support = { version = "25.0.0", default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git" }
frame-system = { version = "25.0.0", default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git" }
sp-std = { version = "25.0.0", default-features = false, git = "https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk.git" }

// In pallets/emr/src/lib.rs
#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn user_identity)]
pub type UserIdentity<T: Config> = StorageMap<
    _,
    Twox64Concat,
    T::AccountId,
    IdentityInfo<T::AccountId, <T as frame_system::Config>::BlockNumber>,
    OptionQuery
>;

// Custom struct for EMR-specific identity info
#[derive(Encode, Decode, Clone, RuntimeDebug, TypeInfo, MaxEncodedLen)]
#[scale_info(skip_type_params(T))]
pub struct EMRIdentityInfo<T: Config> {
    pub identity: IdentityInfo<T::AccountId, <T as frame_system::Config>::BlockNumber>,
    pub verified: bool,
    pub verification_level: VerificationLevel,
    pub last_verified: Option<BlockNumberFor<T>>,
}

#[pallet::storage]
#[pallet::getter(fn emr_identity)]
pub type EMRIdentity<T: Config> = StorageMap<
    _,
    Twox64Concat,
    T::AccountId,
    EMRIdentityInfo<T>,
    OptionQuery
>;

#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    #[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::register_did())]
    pub fn register_did(origin: OriginFor<T>, did: Did) -> DispatchResult {
        let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
        // Implementation logic for DID registration
        Self::deposit_event(Event::DidRegistered(who, did));
        Ok(())
    }
    
    // Additional DID management functions
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Identity Lifecycle Testing
   - Test identity creation and registration with various info fields
   - Verify sub-identity management (up to 100 per account)
   - Test identity updates and removal
   - Verify deposit and fee calculations

2. Verification and Attestation
   - Test registrar verification flows
   - Verify attestation of identity fields
   - Test verification levels and access control
   - Verify identity revocation and recovery

3. Integration Testing
   - Test EMR access control based on identity verification
   - Verify cross-chain identity resolution with People Chain
   - Test identity-based permissions for EMR operations
   - Verify compatibility with wallet integrations

4. Performance Testing
   - Test with maximum number of sub-identities (100)
   - Measure identity verification performance under load
   - Test concurrent identity operations
   - Verify scalability with large numbers of identities

5. Security Testing
   - Test permission boundaries for identity management
   - Verify secure handling of identity deposits
   - Test recovery mechanisms for lost keys
   - Verify resistance to common attacks (replay, spoofing, etc.)
2. Verify DID verification through KILT network
3. Test linking of attestations to DIDs
4. Validate zero-knowledge proof functionality
5. Test DID revocation and updates
6. Verify integration with EMR access control
7. Performance testing of DID operations
