# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate KILT Protocol for Decentralized Identity
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement integration with KILT Protocol to provide secure, verifiable digital identities for all system participants.
# Details:
1. Add KILT Protocol dependencies to the project
2. Implement DID creation and management functionality
3. Develop verification mechanisms for DIDs through the KILT network
4. Create functionality for linking DIDs to on-chain attestations and credentials
5. Implement zero-knowledge proof support for privacy-preserving verification
6. Develop interfaces for DID management in the runtime

Pseudo-code for KILT integration:
```rust
// In runtime/cargo.toml
[dependencies]
kilt_primitives = { git = "https://github.com/KILTprotocol/kilt-node", default-features = false }
kilt_did = { git = "https://github.com/KILTprotocol/kilt-node", default-features = false }

// In runtime/src/lib.rs
impl kilt_did::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
    type Public = AccountId;
    type Signature = Signature;
    // Other KILT DID specific configuration
}

// In emr_pallet/src/lib.rs
use kilt_did::Did;

#[pallet::storage]
pub type UserDids<T: Config> = StorageMap<_, Blake2_128Concat, T::AccountId, Did>;

#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    #[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::register_did())]
    pub fn register_did(origin: OriginFor<T>, did: Did) -> DispatchResult {
        let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
        // Implementation logic for DID registration
        Self::deposit_event(Event::DidRegistered(who, did));
        Ok(())
    }
    
    // Additional DID management functions
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test DID creation for different user types
2. Verify DID verification through KILT network
3. Test linking of attestations to DIDs
4. Validate zero-knowledge proof functionality
5. Test DID revocation and updates
6. Verify integration with EMR access control
7. Performance testing of DID operations
