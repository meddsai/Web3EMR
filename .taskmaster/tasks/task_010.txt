# Web3EMR Architecture Overview

Web3EMR is a decentralized Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system built on a Substrate-based blockchain. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture.

## System Components

### 1. Blockchain Layer

The foundation of Web3EMR is a Substrate-based blockchain that provides:

- Decentralized consensus and immutable record-keeping
- Smart contract functionality through custom pallets
- Access control and permission management
- Audit trail for all system operations

Key pallets include:
- EMR Pallet: Manages EMR references and access control
- Identity Pallet: Integrates with KILT Protocol for decentralized identity

### 2. Storage Layer

EMR data is stored off-chain using StorageHub, providing:

- Encrypted storage of medical records
- Data redundancy across multiple storage nodes
- Fast retrieval for authorized requests
- Data integrity verification

### 3. Frontend Layer

The user interface is built with React and provides:

- Patient portal for EMR management
- Healthcare provider interface
- Wallet integration for blockchain transactions
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Data Flow

1. Patient creates a KILT DID and links it to their Polkadot.js wallet
2. Patient uploads an EMR, which is encrypted and stored on StorageHub
3. A reference to the EMR is stored on the blockchain
4. Patient grants access to healthcare providers through the blockchain
5. Healthcare providers use their DIDs to request access to EMRs
6. Access is verified on-chain before EMR retrieval is permitted
7. All access events are logged on the blockchain for audit purposes

## Security Model

Web3EMR employs a multi-layered security approach:

- Encryption: AES-256 for all EMR data
- Access Control: Granular, patient-controlled permissions
- Identity: Verifiable credentials through KILT Protocol
- Audit: Immutable logging of all system operations

## Compliance Framework

The system is designed to comply with healthcare regulations including:

- HIPAA: Through encryption, access controls, and audit logging
- GDPR: Through consent management and data portability features
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Verify API references match implemented functionality
3. Test user guides with sample scenarios
4. Verify development guides with test implementations
5. Review security documentation for best practices
6. Test deployment guides in different environments
7. Verify compliance documentation against regulatory requirements
8. Test troubleshooting guides against common issues
