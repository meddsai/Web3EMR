# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Substrate Blockchain Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize and configure the Substrate-based blockchain that will serve as the foundation for the Web3EMR system.
# Details:
1. Install Rust and required dependencies for Substrate development
2. Initialize a new Substrate node template
3. Configure the runtime with required system pallets (System, Timestamp, Balances)
4. Set up the consensus mechanism to Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)
5. Configure block time to 6 seconds as specified
6. Optimize for transaction throughput of >1,000 TPS
7. Set up development, testing, and production environments
8. Configure network parameters for the blockchain
9. Implement basic node operation and synchronization

Code structure:
```rust
// Runtime configuration example
#[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, PartialEq, RuntimeDebug, TypeInfo)]
pub struct Runtime {
    pub system: frame_system::GenesisConfig,
    pub timestamp: pallet_timestamp::GenesisConfig,
    pub balances: pallet_balances::GenesisConfig<Runtime>,
    // Additional configuration will be added in later tasks
}

// NPoS consensus configuration
pub fn get_consensus_config() -> ConsensusConfig {
    ConsensusConfig {
        block_time: 6, // 6 seconds block time
        // Additional NPoS parameters
    }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify node startup and synchronization
2. Measure block production time to ensure it meets the 6-second requirement
3. Conduct load testing to verify >1,000 TPS capability
4. Test network stability under various conditions
5. Verify that all required pallets are correctly integrated
6. Ensure proper functioning of the NPoS consensus mechanism
7. Validate that the node can connect to the network and maintain synchronization
