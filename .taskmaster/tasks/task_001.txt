# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Substrate Blockchain Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize and configure the Substrate-based blockchain that will serve as the foundation for the Web3EMR system.
# Details:
1. Install Rust and required dependencies
2. Initialize a new Substrate node template
3. Configure the node for Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus
4. Set block time to 6 seconds as specified
5. Configure runtime for >1000 TPS throughput
6. Include System, Timestamp, and Balances pallets
7. Setup development and testing environments
8. Configure node for integration with off-chain workers

Pseudo-code for node setup:
```rust
// In node/cargo.toml
[dependencies]
substrate = { git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate", branch = "master" }
// Additional dependencies

// In runtime/src/lib.rs
impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
    // System configuration
    type BlockHashCount = BlockHashCount;
    type BlockWeights = BlockWeights;
    type BlockLength = BlockLength;
    // Configure for 6-second block time
    type MinimumPeriod = ConstU32<3000>; // 3000 milliseconds (half of block time)
    // Other configurations
}

// NPoS Configuration
impl pallet_nomination_pools::Config for Runtime {
    // NPoS specific configuration
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify node startup and synchronization
2. Measure block production time to ensure 6-second target is met
3. Conduct load testing to verify >1000 TPS capacity
4. Test consensus mechanism with multiple validators
5. Verify integration with off-chain workers
6. Run integration tests for System, Timestamp, and Balances pallets
