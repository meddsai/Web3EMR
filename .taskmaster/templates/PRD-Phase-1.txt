# Web3EMR: Decentralized Electronic Medical Records System
# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Phase 1: Foundation

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
Web3EMR is a decentralized Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system built on the Polkadot SDK that empowers patients with complete control over their medical records while ensuring security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. By leveraging the Polkadot SDK, decentralized identity management, and secure off-chain storage, Web3EMR aims to transform healthcare data management by putting patients at the center of their healthcare journey.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current EMR systems suffer from several critical issues:
- Centralized control by healthcare providers, limiting patient access and ownership
- Data silos preventing efficient sharing between different healthcare providers
- Security vulnerabilities in centralized storage systems
- Complex compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR
- Lack of transparent audit trails for data access and modifications
- Limited patient control over who can access their medical information

### 1.3 Target Users
1. **Patients**: Individuals seeking control over their medical records
2. **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals
3. **Healthcare Entities**: Hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare organizations
4. **Medical Boards and Accreditation Bodies**: Organizations that validate credentials
5. **Regulatory Authorities**: Bodies ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- Number of patients using the system to manage their EMRs
- Number of healthcare providers and entities registered on the platform
- Volume of EMRs securely stored and accessed through the system
- Reduction in unauthorized access incidents compared to traditional EMR systems
- Compliance verification success rate for regulatory audits
- User satisfaction ratings from both patients and healthcare providers

## 2. Core Features for Phase 1

- Support for identity recovery mechanisms
- Integration with the EMR system for access control

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can create and manage their Polkadot Identity
- System supports hierarchical identity structures with sub-identities
- Identity verification by trusted registrars is functional
- Selective disclosure of attributes works as expected
- Identity recovery mechanisms are secure and reliable
- EMR access control integrates with Polkadot Identity
**Description**: Integration with KILT Protocol for secure, verifiable digital identities for all system participants.

**Requirements**:
- Support for KILT DID creation and management for patients, personnel, and entities
- Verification of DIDs through the KILT network
- Linking of DIDs to on-chain attestations and credentials
- Support for zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All users can create and manage KILT DIDs through the system
- DIDs are verifiable on the KILT network
- Attestations are correctly linked to DIDs
- Zero-knowledge proofs function correctly for credential verification without revealing sensitive data

### 2.3 Secure EMR Storage and Access
**Description**: Encrypted storage of EMRs on StorageHub with blockchain-based access control.

**Requirements**:
- EMRs must be encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- Only hash references to EMRs are stored on-chain
- Access control lists are maintained on the blockchain
- Only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt EMRs
- All access attempts are logged on-chain

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- EMRs are successfully encrypted and stored on CESS (Cumulus Encrypted Storage System)
- Content-addressable hashes (CIDs) are stored on the blockchain
- Only users with permission can retrieve and decrypt EMRs from CESS
- Data integrity is verifiable using on-chain CIDs
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked and logged
- Access logs are immutable and verifiable
- Data redundancy and availability meet healthcare industry standards
