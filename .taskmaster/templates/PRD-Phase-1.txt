# Web3EMR: Decentralized Electronic Medical Records System
# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Phase 1: Foundation

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
Web3EMR is a decentralized Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system built on a Substrate-based blockchain that empowers patients with complete control over their medical records while ensuring security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. By leveraging blockchain technology, decentralized identity management, and secure off-chain storage, Web3EMR aims to transform healthcare data management by putting patients at the center of their healthcare journey.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current EMR systems suffer from several critical issues:
- Centralized control by healthcare providers, limiting patient access and ownership
- Data silos preventing efficient sharing between different healthcare providers
- Security vulnerabilities in centralized storage systems
- Complex compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR
- Lack of transparent audit trails for data access and modifications
- Limited patient control over who can access their medical information

### 1.3 Target Users
1. **Patients**: Individuals seeking control over their medical records
2. **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals
3. **Healthcare Entities**: Hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare organizations
4. **Medical Boards and Accreditation Bodies**: Organizations that validate credentials
5. **Regulatory Authorities**: Bodies ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations

### 1.4 Success Metrics
- Number of patients using the system to manage their EMRs
- Number of healthcare providers and entities registered on the platform
- Volume of EMRs securely stored and accessed through the system
- Reduction in unauthorized access incidents compared to traditional EMR systems
- Compliance verification success rate for regulatory audits
- User satisfaction ratings from both patients and healthcare providers

## 2. Core Features for Phase 1

### 2.1 Patient-Centric Control
**Description**: Patients have full ownership and control over their medical records through cryptographic wallets and decentralized identities.

**Requirements**:
- Patients must be able to create and manage their KILT DIDs
- Patients must be able to upload, view, and manage their EMRs
- Patients must have granular control over who can access their records
- System must provide intuitive interfaces for managing access permissions
- Patients must be able to revoke access at any time

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Patient can successfully create a KILT DID and link it to their Polkadot.js wallet
- Patient can upload an EMR that is encrypted and stored on StorageHub
- Patient can grant and revoke access to specific healthcare providers
- All access control changes are reflected immediately in the system

### 2.2 Decentralized Identity Management
**Description**: Integration with KILT Protocol for secure, verifiable digital identities for all system participants.

**Requirements**:
- Support for KILT DID creation and management for patients, personnel, and entities
- Verification of DIDs through the KILT network
- Linking of DIDs to on-chain attestations and credentials
- Support for zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All users can create and manage KILT DIDs through the system
- DIDs are verifiable on the KILT network
- Attestations are correctly linked to DIDs
- Zero-knowledge proofs function correctly for credential verification without revealing sensitive data

### 2.3 Secure EMR Storage and Access
**Description**: Encrypted storage of EMRs on StorageHub with blockchain-based access control.

**Requirements**:
- EMRs must be encrypted using AES-256 before storage
- Only hash references to EMRs are stored on-chain
- Access control lists are maintained on the blockchain
- Only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt EMRs
- All access attempts are logged on-chain

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- EMRs are successfully encrypted and stored on StorageHub
- Only hash references are stored on the blockchain
- Only users with permission can access and decrypt EMRs
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked and logged
- Access logs are immutable and verifiable
