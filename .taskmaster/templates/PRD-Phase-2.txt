### 2.1 Credential Attestation System
**Description**: A system for verifying and attesting the credentials of healthcare entities and personnel.

**Requirements**:
- Healthcare entities must be able to register with verifiable accreditation
- Medical personnel must be able to have their credentials (e.g., medical licenses) attested
- Attestations must be linked to KILT DIDs and validated by authorized organizations
- Attestations must include expiry information and be revocable

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Entities can register with verifiable accreditation
- Personnel can have their credentials attested and linked to their DID

- Expired or revoked attestations are properly reflected in the system

### 2.2 Immutable Audit Trail
**Description**: On-chain logging of all system events for transparency and compliance.

**Requirements**:
- All EMR access events must be logged on-chain
- All attestation events must be logged on-chain
- Logs must include timestamp, actor, action, and target
- Logs must be immutable and tamper-proof
- Authorized users must be able to view relevant logs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All system events are properly logged on the blockchain
- Logs cannot be altered or deleted
- Patients can view a complete history of access to their records
- Regulators can audit the system for compliance verification

### 2.3 Enhanced Identity Management
**Description**: Advanced KILT Protocol integration with expanded credential management.

**Requirements**:
- Support for complex credential structures and hierarchies
- Enhanced verification mechanisms for credentials
- Support for credential delegation and proxy access
- Improved revocation mechanisms

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Complex credential structures can be created and verified
- Delegation of access works correctly and securely
- Revocation mechanisms function properly and immediately

2. **Administrative Portal** depends on Credential Attestation and Entity Registration

## 7. Appendix for Phase 2

### 7.1 Glossary Additions

**Attestation**: A claim made by one party about another, verified by a trusted third party.

**DID (Decentralized Identifier)**: A new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.

**KILT Protocol**: A blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers.

**ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)**: A method by which one party can prove to another that they know a value, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value.
